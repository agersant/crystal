Places

PLACE1

The White Marches
Bordered to the South and the West by PLACE2 and the Ghangan Mountain Ridge, to the North and West by the Great Peaks and an endless frozen wasteland. Complex fealty relationships and family alliances create a web of endless conflicts. The marches are a swathe of countless tiny states, interlocked in ageless power struggles. The harsh climate of the region limits open war and conquests to at most a few weeks every year.

Holy Empire of Valogna
Pope Theodorus. Lion people. Mediterranean.

Nova Luzia
Decaying canal city. Lots of bridges, overhangs above water and tall structures (features stretched vertically) - partially overgrown.

Khel Zet, the Toad Kingdom
The swamp land and mangrove forest sitting above the ruins of the city of Luzia, inhabited by imbecile toads.

PLACE3

LOSTLIBRARY



Characters
----------

Gornet
	Gornet is a distrustful and lonely boar mercenary, loyal to no one and weary of friendship. In his homeland of PLACE1, he is remembered as the rowdy brawler whose heroic deeds helped free the region from FACTION1. Even then, he departed soon after and while at the peak of his glory, never to return. Most assume he has died since, but in reality he spent the next 30 years wandering WORLD and lived many different lives in search of his true calling and a new reason to fight. His lack of bonds have made him a well-travelled warrior whose prowesses in combat are reknown in many kingdoms - often under different alias and with varying fondness. As years went by, he grew more jaded with the world and the pettiness of men until he reached his current state of broodiness and contempt.
	His weapons of choice are an oversized broadsword and a heavy gauntlet used for punching. Combat style is agressive, unruly and full of risk - protected only by light armor and his surprising mobility.

Iris
	Iris is a scholarly cat with insatiable and candid curiosity. She grew up in PLACE3 where she was raised by her father, from whom she inherited her wisdom and appetite for knowledge. One day, he disappeared to another plane of existence in a failed magic experiment, leaving only a bizarre pendant behind. She decided to learn the ways of magic too, in order to find out what happened to her father. After exhausting her father's studies, she set out on a quest for LOSTLIBRARY where the missing pieces of the puzzle might reside. Iris is good natured and tends to assume everyone else has equally pure intentions as she does.
	Her weapon of choice is a magic staff, which she uses to cast a variety of offensive and curative magic.

Allegro
	Allegro is a lighthearted shrew with a burning passion for the arts and romanesque stories. He grew up as the heir to the Frescobaldi family but never had much of a taste for mercantile or military education. After spending his youth running away from the palace to frequent taverns, salons and bordellos, he eventually joined a travelling theater troupe and exiled himself from Nova Luzia. In search of greater adventures and fame, he later left the troupe and started travelling on his own as a wandering minstrel. Despite having many friends and lovers in many countries, Allegro isn't good at forging lasting bonds with others - interacting with people as an audience more than as peers.
	His weapon of choice is a bow. Combat style is flashy but tactical, with a good mix of crowd control and support abilities together with damage.
