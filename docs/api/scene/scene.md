# crystal.Scene

Game state or level which can draw to the screen. Crystal keeps track of the currently active scene and forwards LÃ–VE callbacks (update, draw, etc.) to it.

{: .note}
This class is of little use on its own. You should implement subclasses fitting your game and override some of the callbacks.

## Constructor

```lua
crystal.Scene:new()
```
