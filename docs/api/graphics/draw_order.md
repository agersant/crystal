# crystal.DrawOrder

A [Component](/crystal/api/ecs/component) that determines in what order entities are drawn. For more information on draw order, see [Drawable:drawable_set_draw_order_modifier](drawable_set_draw_order_modifier).

This base class is of little use without overriding the `draw_order()` method.

## Constructor

Like all other components, `DrawOrder` components are created by calling [Entity:add_component](/crystal/api/ecs/entity_add_component).

The constructor for DrawOrder expects no arguments.

## Methods

| Name       | Description |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| draw_order |             |

## Examples

```lua
